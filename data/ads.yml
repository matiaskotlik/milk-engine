  desc:  Getting to that age where you can't provide for yourself (and your milk engine)? Not to worry! Through a complex and painful process named "electro-milking", each one of our Milk Farms can produce almost 200 liters (almost 52 Gallons for you americans!) of milk a day, which is then sold wholesale to you!
