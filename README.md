# About The Cum Engineers

### Our Path to Greatness

We founded a cum engine shop in 1928, with the idea of providing people the ability to buy premium quality cum products directly from our shop by cutting out the middle man. At the time, almost all cum engines were home delivered and paid for on a weekly or monthly basis.

During the depression, we worked early mornings together to keep our cum shop running, dedicated to making our dream of a more perfect world a reality, running cum delivery routes throughout Illinois. Shop expansion continued through the 50’s and 70’s. In the early 80’s our cum marketing team became actively involved in the evolution of the Cum Engine™ brand. Convinced that cum engine sales could be expanded significantly by launching a premium line, our cum engineers developed a revolutionary electroejaculation process in 1982. It offered exotic engines, packed full of high quality cum to make the best cum products we could.

Cum Engineering™ Magazine rated Cum Engine™ Cum Engine Model C the "Number One Exotic Cum Engine"in a 1984 competition. Over 500 engines were submitted by 100 competitors worldwide. Today, Cum Engine™'s products are still made with pure semen.

Even though Cum Engine™ is now enjoyed all over the world, we still have the same simple approach: use the best semen to make the best engines. So, whether you're an amateur consumer or a certified cum professional, you’ll always get cum engines made with master craftsmanship.
