# About The Milk Engineers

### Our Path to Greatness

We founded a milk engine shop in 1928, with the idea of providing people the ability to buy premium quality milk products directly from our shop by cutting out the middle man. At the time, almost all milk engines were home delivered and paid for on a weekly or monthly basis.

During the depression, we worked early mornings together to keep our milk shop running, dedicated to making our dream of a more perfect world a reality, running milk delivery routes throughout Illinois. Shop expansion continued through the 50’s and 70’s. In the early 80’s our milk marketing team became actively involved in the evolution of the Milk Engine™ brand. Convinced that milk engine sales could be expanded significantly by launching a premium line, our milk engineers developed a revolutionary milk-refinement process in 1982. It offered exotic engines, packed full of high quality milk to make the best milk products we could.

Milk Engineering™ Magazine rated Milk Engine™ Milk Engine Model C the "Number One Exotic Milk Engine" in a 1984 competition. Over 500 engines were submitted by 100 competitors worldwide. Today, Milk Engine™'s products are still made with pure milk.

Even though Milk Engine™ is now enjoyed all over the world, we still have the same simple approach: use the best milk to make the best engines. So, whether you're an amateur consumer or a certified milk professional, you’ll always get milk engines made with master craftsmanship.
